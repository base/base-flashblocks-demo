Setup your envvironment variables, you can do this by creating .env.local and setting a value for `BASE_RPC_URL`.
This should be the url of the rpc endpoint of the blockchain you want to connect to.

Then you can run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
